# CHECKLIST

Before working on a feature, it's recommended to check out the [issues](https://github.com/SpaceyaTech/CoLabs-Frontend/issues) and assign yourself one. If none of them interest you, you can [check out the Figma file](https://www.figma.com/design/2r8LJbRj7TEXZ7obQvVeb8/SpaceYaTech-Website-Re-design?node-id=4-598&node-type=canvas&t=ZX1LpTU4llEME87H-0) and identify the feature you want to work on.
- Create an issue on GitHub with the feature you want to work on and assign yourself.

    npm run dryrun
```
